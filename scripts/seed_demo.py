"""Realistic demo campus data for UNIFIX. Idempotent. Run: python scripts/seed_demo.py

Builds ~35 grievances from several faculty across every category, spread over the
last six weeks, in every workflow state — enough for the dashboard, Pulse, Gaps
and Analytics to look meaningful. Includes the MVP recurring "Room 204 projector"
scenario and an AB1 electrical gap.
