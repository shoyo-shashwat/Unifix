# UNIFIX — GL Bajaj Campus Infrastructure Intelligence

Employees report campus infrastructure problems from their phone; a single Super
Admin ("Sir") reviews, routes, tracks and verifies every grievance. The system
turns individual reports into a live picture of infrastructure health, recurring
failures and maintenance priorities.

**Report → Understand → Prioritize → Assign → Resolve → Verify → Learn**

## Run it (development)

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                 # dev server on http://localhost:5000
```

Config is read from a gitignored `.env` in the project root (loaded via
python-dotenv). With no `DATABASE_URL` the dev server runs **in-memory** (data
lost on restart) — fine for local work; it logs a warning so you know. The
variables the app reads: `APP_ENV`, `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`,
`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` / `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` /
`FIREBASE_KEY_JSON` / `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_B64` (+ `ALLOW_FIRESTORE_IN_DEV`),
`GROQ_API_KEY` / `GROQ_MODEL_TEXT` / `GROQ_MODEL_VISION`, `RESEND_API_KEY` /
`RESEND_FROM` / `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL`, `R2_*` or `AWS_*`/`S3_BUCKET_NAME` for
evidence-photo storage, `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `INITIAL_ADMIN_PIN` (prod
bootstrap), `TWA_PACKAGE_NAME` / `TWA_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINTS` (Android),
`SEED_DEMO`, `ALLOW_PROD_DEMO_SEED`, `PORT`, `FLASK_DEBUG`.

## Deploy it (production)

Production is `APP_ENV=production`. It is strict on purpose and **will refuse to
start** unless the environment is safe:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET` set, ≥ 32 chars, not a default | session / JWT forgery protection |
| `DATABASE_URL` set and reachable | PostgreSQL is the primary store; there is **no** silent in-memory fallback in production |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` + `INITIAL_ADMIN_PIN` (first deploy only) | no automatic `admin`/`0000` in production; the seeded admin must change its PIN on first login |

If PostgreSQL is down and a Firestore fallback is configured, the app runs on
Firestore and logs that it has entered fallback mode. If **neither** is
available, the app exits loudly rather than pretend to work.

Demo/sample data is never seeded into a production database unless
`ALLOW_PROD_DEMO_SEED=1` is explicitly set.

```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app             # see Procfile
```

### Database (Postgres)

`db/pool.py` opens a **short-lived psycopg connection per db call** and closes
it — there is no client-side connection pool. (psycopg_pool's background
connection-opener threads proved unreliable under gunicorn on Render: boot
connected fine, then every request timed out in `getconn()`.) Connection
pooling is delegated to the database side.

- **Use a managed pooler in front of Postgres.** With Supabase, point
  `DATABASE_URL` at the **pooler host** (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`,
  user `postgres.<project-ref>`), not the direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` host
  (which is IPv6-only on the free tier). Session pooler `5432` or transaction
  pooler `6543` both work — the code sets `prepare_threshold=None`. Append
  `?sslmode=require`.
- **Co-locate the app and the database in the same region.** A cross-continent
  hop (e.g. app in Render Oregon, DB in Supabase Singapore) adds ~150–200 ms per
  round trip; a fresh connection needs several, so every request crawls or times
  out. Match the regions (Render Oregon ↔ Supabase West US).
- **Neon free tier** additionally suspends compute after ~5 min idle and caps
  monthly compute hours — avoid for a live deployment. Supabase free stays warm
  (pauses only after ~7 days of zero activity).
- A small **always-on paid instance** (~$7/mo) is the robust option once the
  pilot proves out.

### Deploy on Render (checklist)

Set these in the Render dashboard → service → **Environment** (never commit a
`.env`):

| Var | Value |
|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | `production` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase pooler URL (`...pooler.supabase.com`), same region as the Render service, + `?sslmode=require` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | 40+ random chars |
| `JWT_SECRET` | 40+ random chars (different from `SECRET_KEY`) |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `INITIAL_ADMIN_PIN` | first deploy only; PIN must be changed on first login |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM` | as before |

Tables and the GL Bajaj location tree are created automatically on first boot.
Confirm success in the logs: `UNIFIX starting — env=production, db=postgres`.

## Accounts

**Development** seeds these automatically:

| Role | Username | PIN |
|---|---|---|
| Super Admin | `admin` | `0000` |
| Employee | `prof.rao`, `dr.iyer`, `prof.khan`, `prof.sharma` | `1234` |

**Production** has no default accounts — the first admin comes from
`INITIAL_ADMIN_*`. The admin creates further accounts at `/admin/users`.

### Admin tiers

The MVP has a single admin tier: every `admin` can perform every admin action,
including creating other admins (whitelisted role, audited as `admin.create`).
This is a deliberate decision for a one-coordinator campus — see `domain/rbac.py`.

## Demo data

```bash
SEED_DEMO=1 python scripts/seed_demo.py   # dev/test only; ~35 grievances,
                                          # recurring "Room 204 projector", Block B gaps
```

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest        # in-memory backend, no external services
```

## Campus locations

Locations are a real tree the admin maintains at **`/admin/locations`**:

```
GL Bajaj campus
 ├── AB1 / AB2 (building) → Floor → Room (+ room type)
 ├── B.Tech / MBA / BCA Canteen, Library, SHD Hall, Medical Facility → (specific area)
 ├── Hostels, Playground
 └── Outer Area → sub-zone
```

Only **verified** structure is seeded (AB1, AB2, the named facilities). **No room
numbers are invented** — enter the real GL Bajaj room list at `/admin/locations`;
no code change or redeploy needed. A reporter picks a node in the report wizard;
if a room isn't catalogued yet they pick the floor and type the number. Each
grievance stores both the `location_id` and the flat building/floor/room/facility
fields, so existing reports never break and the admin queue can filter by any of
them.

## Android / Google Play

UNIFIX ships to Play as a **Trusted Web Activity** (no native rewrite). See
`android/README.md` for the build, and `docs/GOOGLE_PLAY_READINESS.md` for the
full A–G readiness checklist, `docs/PLAY_DATA_SAFETY.md`, and
`docs/PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md`.
